## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Hameed

I have a passion for **JavaScript/Typescript** and website development.
I'm currently a fullstack developer at **YouNet Media**, deeply engaged in the **EcomHeat** project, which entails market share management, competitor research, and fostering e-commerce growth.
I work mainly with **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **React**, **NodeJS**, **NestJS**, and **NextJS**.

## Why create another blog in a world already overflowing with them?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

This space is a reflection of my unique journe from a full-stack developer solving technical challenges to a Product owner bridging innovation and strategy.

This blog serves two purposes:

- __To Share:__ Insights, lessons, and strategies I’ve gathered while navigating the intersection of tech and product.

- __To Store:__ A personal repository of what I’ve learned, read, and applied —a digital journal to ensure nothing gets forgotten as time flys.


Whether you’re a developer curious about product thinking, a product owner exploring tech, or someone seeking fresh perspectives, I hope this blog adds value.

For me, it’s about learning, sharing, and growing one post at a time.
