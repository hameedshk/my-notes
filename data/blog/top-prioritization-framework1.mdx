## Introduction

Feature prioritization is a critical task in product management, where you decide which features or enhancements should be developed and released first based on various factors like <em><ins>cost,value, effort, impact, and alignment</ins></em> with business goals.

Effective prioritization ensures that the product development team focuses on the most important features that deliver the highest value to users and the business.

### Why Feature prioritization ?

- **Resource Management**: Development resources (time, budget, people) are often limited, so prioritizing features ensures optimal use of these resources.

- **Strategic Alignment**: Helps ensure that the development work aligns with the company’s strategic goals.

- **User Satisfaction**: By prioritizing features that address the most pressing user needs, you improve user satisfaction and retention.

- **Market Relevance**: Keeps your product competitive by focusing on features that differentiate your product in the market.

- **Stress reduction**: From customer interactions to executive presentations, the responsibilities of a PM are vast and varied, often leading to a risk of burnout if not managed adeptly.

### Prioritization frameworks

Feature prioritization frameworks help teams make informed decisions on which features to build, improve, or drop. Here’s a detailed look at some of the most popular frameworks:

#### 1.<ins> Value vs Effort Matrix </ins>

**Overview**: This matrix helps you prioritize features by comparing their expected **<ins>value</ins>** (benefit) against the <ins>**effort**</ins> (resources) required to implement them.

**Steps**:
List Features: Write down all potential features.

- **Estimate Value**: For each feature, estimate the potential value it will bring to users or the business. Value can be assessed by how well the feature aligns with business goals, user needs, or competitive advantage.
- **Estimate Effort**: Estimate the effort in terms of time, resources, and complexity to build each feature.
- **Plot on the Matrix**: Place each feature on a 2x2 matrix where one axis is Value (Low to High) and the other is Effort (Low to High).

  [Prioritize]: #

  {' '}

  {' '}

  <ins>High Value, Low Effort(Quick wins)</ins> : These are quick wins and should be prioritized.
  {' '}
  <ins>High Value, High Effort(strategic)</ins>: Consider these as strategic projects; they may take time but have
  significant impact.
  {' '}
  <ins>Low Value, Low Effort(fill ins)</ins>: These can be done if resources allow, but they’re not critical,indicating
  it can be worked on when there’s time available
  {' '}
  <ins>Low Value, High Effort(time sinks)</ins>: These are often not worth pursuing unless necessary for strategic
  reasons.
  <br />

[Example Features]: #

Feature A is a quick win, offering high value with low effort.

Feature D is a strategic project, with both high value and high effort.

Feature G is a fill-in, providing low value with minimal effort.

Feature B is a time sink, requiring high effort but offering less value.

This matrix helps prioritize which features to tackle first, ensuring that resources are used efficiently to maximize impact. ​​

**Pros**: Simple and visual; easy to understand.
**Cons**: Subjective estimates; doesn’t consider user impact in a nuanced way as its subjective estimation ,biased
,Bias Toward Measurable Value ,Overemphasis on Quick Wins

#### 4.<ins>Kano Model</ins>

Developed by Professor Noriaki Kano in the 1980s -This model is particularly useful for understanding and prioritizing customer satisfaction and delight, helping teams to differentiate between essential features and those that can significantly enhance user satisfaction.
These categories help product managers and teams prioritize features by understanding how each feature influences customer happiness.

![Diagram Kano Model](/my-notes/static/images/blogs/kano1.png)

Kano Model Categories

**Must-Be (Basic expectations):** These are fundamental features that customers expect. Their absence leads to dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn’t significantly increase satisfaction because they are assumed to be a given.

Examples: A mobile phone must have basic calling functionality, or a website must load when accessed.
Impact: These are "hygiene factors" that do not necessarily delight the customer but are necessary to avoid dissatisfaction.

**One-Dimensional (Performance Needs):** These features have a direct relationship with customer satisfaction. The better you execute on these features, the more satisfied customers will be.

Examples: Faster load times on a website, better battery life on a smartphone.

Impact: Performance needs provide a competitive advantage and are often the focus for continuous improvement.
Attractive (Excitement Needs): These are features that customers do not expect but are delighted when they experience them. They can create significant positive feelings.

Examples: A free add-on service, surprise discounts, or innovative design features.

Impact: Attractive features can set a product apart from competitors and increase customer loyalty.

**Indifferent:** Features that customers are indifferent about; they neither increase nor decrease satisfaction.

Examples: Features that are nice to have but do not influence the customer’s purchase decision.
Impact: These features should be minimized or avoided as they do not add significant value.

**Reverse:** Features that some customers may like, but others may dislike. These can create satisfaction for one group and dissatisfaction for another.
Examples: A highly customizable interface might be appreciated by power users but confusing for average users.
Impact: These features require careful consideration and often need to be tailored to specific customer segments.

![Diagram example Kano Model](/my-notes/static/images/blogs/kano2.png)

**Applying the Kano Model**

**Customer Surveys:** Use surveys to ask customers how they would feel if a feature was present or absent. This can help you categorize features into the Kano categories.

**Prioritization:** Once features are categorized, focus on ensuring all Must-Be features are included, optimizing One-Dimensional features, and strategically adding Attractive features to surprise and delight customers.

**Review and Iterate:** As customer expectations evolve, regularly review and update the feature categories to ensure alignment with current market demands.

**Pros and Cons of the Kano Model**

**Pros:**

- Helps in prioritizing features based on actual customer satisfaction.
- Encourages a focus on innovation and customer delight.
- Provides a framework for balancing basic needs with exciting features.

**Cons:**

- Requires detailed customer feedback, which can be time-consuming to gather.
- May be challenging to categorize features accurately without clear customer input.
- The model's qualitative nature can lead to subjective interpretations of results.

The Kano Model is a valuable tool for product managers who want to prioritize features based on customer satisfaction and competitive differentiation. It complements other frameworks like MoSCoW by adding a focus on the emotional impact of features on users.

#### 5.<ins>Eisenhower Matrix -Urgent important matrix</ins>

U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower :This framework is particularly useful for time management and prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance,sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not spend much time on.

![Diagram example eisenhower Matrix](/my-notes/static/images/blogs/eisenhower.png)

The Four Quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix

**Quadrant 1:** Urgent and Important (Do First):

- **Definition:** Tasks that are both urgent and important. These require immediate attention and are crucial to achieving your goals.

- **Examples:** Crises, deadlines, pressing problems.

- **Action:** Do these tasks as soon as possible.

**Quadrant 2:** Not Urgent but Important (Schedule):

- **Definition:** Important tasks that are not urgent. These contribute to long-term goals and development.

- **Examples:** Planning, strategy, learning new skills, relationship-building.

- **Action:** Schedule these tasks for a later time, as they are critical for long-term success.

**Quadrant 3:** Urgent but Not Important (Delegate):

- **Definition:** Tasks that are urgent but not important. They often distract from your main goals.

- **Examples:** Interruptions, some emails or calls, requests from others.

- **Action:** Delegate these tasks to others if possible, or minimize the time spent on them.

**Quadrant 4:** Not Urgent and Not Important (Eliminate):

- **Definition:** Tasks that are neither urgent nor important. These are often time-wasters.

- **Examples:** Busywork, trivial activities, excessive internet browsing.

- **Action:** Eliminate or reduce these tasks, as they do not contribute to your success.

**Benefits of the Eisenhower Matrix**

- **Clarifies Priorities:** Helps you see which tasks are truly important versus those that feel urgent but aren’t crucial.
- **Improves Time Management:** Encourages focusing on tasks that matter most and reduces time spent on non-essential activities.
- **Reduces Stress**: By clearly organizing tasks, you can avoid the overwhelm that comes from handling too many things at once.

Example:Imagine you’re a Product Manager:

![Diagram example eisenhower Matrix](/my-notes/static/images/blogs/eisenhowver-manager.png)

**Pros:**

- **Clarity and Focus:** The Eisenhower Matrix provides a clear structure for decision-making by categorizing tasks into four quadrants: Important/Urgent, Important/Not Urgent, Not Important/Urgent, and Not Important/Not Urgent. This helps in identifying what truly needs immediate attention and what can be deferred or delegated.

- **Improves Productivity:** By focusing on important tasks, especially those that are not urgent (Quadrant II), users can work on strategic goals and prevent crises from occurring, ultimately leading to increased productivity and efficiency.
- **Reduces Stress:** Prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance can reduce the overwhelming feeling that comes with having too many tasks. By tackling high-priority tasks first, you can alleviate stress and maintain better control over your workload.
- **Encourages Delegation:** The matrix promotes effective delegation by helping users identify tasks that are urgent but not important (Quadrant III). Delegating these tasks allows individuals to focus on more critical activities.
- **Enhances Long-term Planning:** By regularly using the Eisenhower Matrix, users are encouraged to focus on long-term goals and strategic planning, rather than just reacting to immediate issues.

**Cons:**

- **Oversimplification:** The matrix categorizes tasks into only four quadrants, which might oversimplify complex tasks or situations. Some tasks might not fit neatly into one category, making the decision process more challenging.
- **Subjectivity:** The determination of what is "important" or "urgent" can be subjective and may vary from person to person. This subjectivity can lead to inconsistent prioritization, especially in team settings.
- **Neglect of Quadrant II:** While the matrix emphasizes the importance of Quadrant II (Important/Not Urgent), users may still gravitate towards urgent tasks, neglecting important but non-urgent tasks that are crucial for long-term success.
- **Does Not Consider Task Dependencies:** The matrix does not account for tasks that are dependent on others or require sequential completion, which can be a limitation in more complex project management scenarios.
- **Time-Consuming:** Regularly categorizing tasks into the matrix can become time-consuming, particularly if you have a large number of tasks or if your priorities frequently change.

#### 6.<ins>Cost Of Delay</ins>

**Cost of Delay (CoD)** helps to quantify the economic impact of delaying a project or feature. It helps prioritize work by focusing not just on the value of delivering something, but also on the cost of not delivering it in a timely manner.
**Key Concepts**

- **Value:** This is the benefit or revenue that a feature or project is expected to generate.
- **Time Sensitivity:** This represents how quickly the value of a feature decreases over time. Some features are more time-sensitive than others.
- **Urgency:** This is the degree to which a delay impacts the overall value. Higher urgency means a higher cost of delay.

**Why Cost of Delay Matters**

**Informed Prioritization:** It helps teams prioritize features or projects that are time-sensitive and would result in higher economic losses if delayed.

**Resource Allocation:** It guides resource allocation towards work that will have the greatest economic impact if delivered sooner.

**Focus on Value:** It shifts focus from simply delivering features to delivering them at the right time to maximize value.

The formula for calculating Cost of Delay is:

```javascript
//CoD is the overall economic impact of delay on the success of a project or product on the market
Cost of Delay = Economic Value * Time sensitivity * Duration of Delay
```

However, in many practical applications, teams use simpler approaches:

1. **Simple Numerical CoD:**

- Assign a dollar value to the potential revenue or cost savings a feature would generate.
- Estimate how much value is lost per time unit (e.g., per week or month) if the feature is delayed.

2. **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF):**

- WSJF is a prioritization technique that uses CoD divided by the job duration (or effort).

```javascript
WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Duration
```

- Prioritize the work with the highest WSJF score, meaning it provides the most value in the shortest time.

**Types of Cost of Delay**

- **Immediate Cost of Delay:** Losses that begin as soon as a feature is delayed, such as lost sales or penalties.
- **Future Cost of Delay:** Potential future revenue or benefits that are reduced or lost because a feature is delivered late.
- **Accumulated Cost of Delay:** Continuous and cumulative losses over time until the feature is delivered.

**Visualizing Cost of Delay**

- CoD Curve: This curve illustrates how the value of a feature diminishes over time. A steep curve indicates high urgency, meaning delays significantly decrease the potential value.
- Cost of Delay Profiles:
  1. Standard Profile: Value decreases at a constant rate over time.
  2. Accelerating Profile: Value decreases slowly at first but then accelerates rapidly.
  3. Fixed Deadline Profile: Value remains stable until a certain deadline, after which it drops sharply.

Here's a diagram illustrating the concept of Cost of Delay over time.
![Diagram example cost of delay ](/my-notes/static/images/blogs/cod.png)

- The blue curve represents how the value of a feature decreases as time progresses.
- Initially, the feature holds high value, but as time passes (e.g., due to delays), the value diminishes, highlighting the increasing cost of delay.

This visual helps to understand that the longer a valuable feature is delayed, the more potential value is lost, emphasizing the importance of timely delivery. ​​

Example:Imagine you have two features:

- Feature A: Expected to generate $50,000/month once released.
- Feature B: Expected to generate $30,000/month, but its value drops by $10,000 every month it's delayed.

If Feature A takes 2 months to build, delaying it by 1 month results in a cost of delay of $50,000.

For Feature B, delaying it by 1 month costs $10,000 , but if delayed by 2 months, the cost is $20,000.

Using Cost of Delay

To effectively use CoD:
Estimate the economic impact: Determine the value of delivering the feature or project on time.
Understand time sensitivity: Evaluate how quickly the value decreases with delay.
Apply WSJF if necessary: Use the WSJF method to combine CoD with job duration for more nuanced prioritization.
Conclusion
Cost of Delay is a powerful tool that helps organizations focus on delivering value at the right time by considering the economic impact of delays. It aligns the team's priorities with business objectives, ensuring that the most time-sensitive and valuable work is prioritized
